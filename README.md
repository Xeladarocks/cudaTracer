# cudaTracer
A CUDA path-tracer that calculates and renders on the GPU.

***Note:** due to bugs and other flaws, this project is abandoned. It will be subject to a remaster with CMake and OpenCL/GL compatibility.*

![Example 1](https://github.com/Xeladarocks/cudaTracer/blob/master/imgs/600p1000s16b.png?raw=true)
600p, 1000 sample, 16 bounce, 20 second render. (real-time is only ~15 fps on that interior scene at low samples)
